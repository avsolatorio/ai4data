// Vocabulary. "The project" is the operational project that finances the
// office. "The program" is AI for Data - Data for AI, which provides tools,
// methods, cookbooks, and advisory work. Each area says what the office
// needs, what the project would finance, what the program provides today,
// and where the program could expand.
