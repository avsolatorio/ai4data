# Glossary

**AI-ready.** Data and metadata that software, including AI systems, can find, retrieve, interpret, and cite without manual steps. See the [AI-ready data framework](/docs/ai-ready-framework).

**Annotation.** Optional properties on a tool that describe its behaviour (for example that it is read-only); hints that clients treat as untrusted unless the server is trusted.

**API.** Application programming interface: the address at which a program asks a system for data and receives it in a structured form.

**Benchmark (population).** The share of each group in the population, from the census or population estimates, against which a dataset's composition is compared.

**Bounding box.** The rectangle that encloses a detected table or figure on a page, written as the left, top, right, and bottom edges as fractions of the page width and height, with the origin at the top left.

**Candidate.** A model shortlisted for a task, with its licence classified and its card checked, to be run on the suite.

**Canonical name.** The one name, with its acronym and identifier, under which a dataset's mentions are counted.

**Checksum.** A fingerprint of a file's content (here SHA-256) that changes if one byte of the file changes; used to prove that a file is as released.

**Code list.** A published table of the codes used in a dataset (for geography, periods, categories) with their labels. In SDMX, a code list is part of the data structure definition.

**Coverage.** The share of a reference list of known uses that the collected documents contain.

**Croissant.** The MLCommons format, built on schema.org, for describing a machine-learning dataset so that tools can load it: its files with their checksums, the fields of each record, and the splits.

**Data snapshot.** The image of one table or figure cropped from a page, with its coordinates, class, and source document; the unit of extraction and of citation.

**DataCite.** The registration agency and metadata schema for dataset DOIs. The World Bank Microdata Library assigns DataCite DOIs.

**Dataset card.** The one document that tells a user what a dataset is, why it exists, how it was collected and labelled, whom it represents, what it is for and not for, its licence, its version, and how to cite it.

**DCAT.** The Data Catalog Vocabulary, a W3C standard for describing data catalogs and their datasets in machine-readable form so that catalogs can be harvested.

**DDI.** The Data Documentation Initiative, the standard for documenting surveys and their variables, value labels, and files; the World Bank microdata schema is based on it.

**Decision.** A curator's recorded verdict on a suggestion: accept, edit (with the final text), or reject (with a reason).

**Disclosure control.** The measurement and reduction of the risk that a released file identifies a person or business or reveals something about one: removal of identifiers, top-coding, coarsening of geography, suppression of rare combinations; applied before any release.

**DOI.** Digital object identifier, a persistent identifier registered with DataCite that resolves to a dataset or to one version of it, carries citation metadata, and makes citations countable.

**Feature.** A column a model may use as input.

**Fine-tuning.** Changing a model's weights by training it further on the organization's own labelled examples, so that it does one task better or follows the organization's conventions.

**Gate.** The rule that decides whether a change ships, applied to a paired comparison of the evaluation suite before and after the change.

**Group key.** The column that names the unit whose records must stay together in a split: a household, a firm, a document.

**Grouped split.** A draw of whole groups (households, documents) into the parts of a dataset, so that no group is divided between training and test.

**ISCO-08.** The International Standard Classification of Occupations, whose four-digit codes classify jobs; the label of the coding examples in this guide.

**Issue.** The review pipeline's output: a detected problem with a category, a severity from 1 to 5, the current value, and a proposed value.

**JSON-LD.** JSON with a vocabulary attached, so that each key has a defined meaning that different tools read the same way; the format in which schema.org and Croissant records are embedded in web pages.

**Label.** The column a model is trained to predict: the occupation code, the transcribed value, the series a question refers to.

**Labelled sample.** Sentences labelled by a person with the dataset mention they contain, or none, used to measure the extractor.

**Language model.** A model that reads and writes text; used in these guides to draft, flag, code, explain, and translate, with a person deciding.

**Layout detection.** A model that finds regions of a page image and returns their class and bounding box.

**Leakage.** Any way the answer reaches a model other than through its features: shared groups across splits, a feature that encodes the label, duplicated inputs.

**LLM.** Large language model. A model that generates text, used here for drafting metadata, answering questions, and grading.

**Lock file.** The record of a model's source, version, and file digests that the server verifies before loading.

**Manifest.** A file that lists the parts of something so that it can be checked or resumed: for a job, the records and their status; for a release, every file with its checksum; for an agent interface, the design document of its tools, inputs, outputs, examples, and resources.

**Map.** The table of model-assisted tasks with phase, role, review, data sensitivity, model location, and owner.

**Maturity level.** One of three states used in this guide: foundational, AI-ready, AI-native.

**Mention.** A reference to a dataset in a document, named or unnamed.

**Metadata Editor.** The World Bank's open-source application for documenting data of all the types in the World Bank schemas, with templates and validation, publishing to NADA, and export to SDMX, schema.org, Croissant, and DCAT.

**ML-ready dataset.** A fixed, versioned set of examples with a documented structure, a stated purpose, a split for training and testing, a statement of whom the examples represent, and a licence that covers model training.

**Public use file.** A microdata file released to anyone under terms of use, after disclosure control.

**RAG.** Retrieval-augmented generation. A pattern where the system retrieves records first and the model writes the answer from them.

**Reference model.** A simple model trained on the dataset and scored on its test part, published as a baseline so that users can compare their scores and see the error by group.

**Representativeness.** The degree to which a dataset's composition matches the population it will be used on, measured group by group and stated in the card.

**Resource.** Context a server offers to the model or the user, such as code lists or a release calendar, identified by a URI.

**Roles.** What a model may do in production: flag, propose, code, explain, draft. It does not decide.

**schema.org.** A vocabulary that search engines agree on for describing things on web pages; a Dataset record in it, embedded in a page, is how dataset search engines learn what the page is about.

**schema.org Dataset.** A vocabulary for describing datasets on web pages, read by general crawlers and dataset search engines.

**SDMX.** Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange, the standard for exchanging aggregate statistical data, their structure, and code lists; its concept names (SERIES, REF_AREA, TIME_PERIOD, OBS_VALUE) are the column names of this series' data files.

**Small model.** A model of roughly one to fifteen billion parameters that runs on one GPU or on CPU, enough for narrow tasks with the right context.

**Split.** The division of a dataset into a training part (the model learns from it), a validation part (the model builder chooses settings on it), and a test part (touched once, to report a score).

**Suite.** A question set, the scripts that score it, the required scores, and the record of runs.

**Synthesis record.** The document that accompanies a synthetic file: source, method and seed, utility and risk results, intended and prohibited uses, label, licence, contact.

**Synthetic data.** Records generated by a model fitted to real data so that they have the same shape and similar relationships while containing no real person's record.

**Thin group.** A group with too few examples for a model to learn its patterns; listed in the card with the minimum count used.

**Threshold.** The value of a score (a confidence, a similarity, a garble rate) at which the rule changes what happens to an item; set from measurements.

**Tidy data.** A table layout with one observation per row and one variable per column.

**Tidy file.** A data file with one record per row, one variable per column, and the same columns in every row; for extracted data, one row per value with provenance columns (document, page, bounding box, class, title, row, column, value, unit, status).

**Time-based test part.** A test part made of the latest round of the source, so that a score describes what a model will do on the next round.

**Total variation distance.** A measure of the difference between two categorical distributions, from 0 (identical) to 1 (no overlap).

**Use.** A document whose analysis, decision, or statement depends on the data, as opposed to a mention that cites them as context.

**Utility.** How closely the synthetic file reproduces the real one at the marginal, association, and analysis levels.

**Verified.** The status of an extracted value that matched a printed label, a total, a derivation, or a catalog value.

**Vocabulary.** A concept scheme with preferred labels, alternates, and URIs, to which free-text keywords and topics are mapped.

**Weight.** A variable that scales each record to the population, with the calibration and the estimates it applies to documented.

**Weight (survey).** The number of population members a record stands for in a survey, kept as a column for population estimates; not a training weight by default.
