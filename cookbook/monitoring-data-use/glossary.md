# Glossary

**Adapter.** A small set of trained parameters added to a model for a task, so that fine-tuning fits on modest hardware (parameter-efficient fine-tuning).

**Agent.** An AI system that calls tools to complete a task; here an assistant that calls the organization's data API or MCP server to answer a question about statistics.

**AI visibility check.** A fixed set of questions asked of AI assistants on a schedule, recording whether the organization is cited and whether the figures are right.

**AI-ready.** Data and metadata that software, including AI systems, can find, retrieve, interpret, and cite without manual steps. See the [AI-ready data framework](/docs/ai-ready-framework).

**Annotation.** Optional properties on a tool that describe its behaviour (for example that it is read-only); hints that clients treat as untrusted unless the server is trusted.

**API.** Application programming interface: the address at which a program asks a system for data and receives it in a structured form.

**Benchmark (population).** The share of each group in the population, from the census or population estimates, against which a dataset's composition is compared.

**Candidate.** A model shortlisted for a task, with its licence classified and its card checked, to be run on the suite.

**Canonical name.** The one name, with its acronym and identifier, under which a dataset's mentions are counted.

**Co-use.** The use of another organization's dataset in the same document as the organization's own.

**Confidence.** A number between 0 and 1 that a model returns with its output to say how sure it is; the basis of a threshold rule.

**Confidence threshold.** The model confidence above which a code is accepted automatically, set from the measured accuracy curve.

**COUNTER Code of Practice for Research Data.** Rules for logging and reporting dataset views and downloads, including the separation of machine access from regular access.

**Coverage.** The share of a reference list of known uses that the collected documents contain.

**Crosswalk.** A mapping from one classification to another, for example from a national occupation classification to ISCO.

**DataCite.** The registration agency and metadata schema for dataset DOIs. The World Bank Microdata Library assigns DataCite DOIs.

**DDI.** The Data Documentation Initiative, the standard for documenting surveys and their variables, value labels, and files; the World Bank microdata schema is based on it.

**Decision.** A curator's recorded verdict on a suggestion: accept, edit (with the final text), or reject (with a reason).

**Document record.** The catalog record of a document in the World Bank document schema, with the series and surveys it draws on.

**DOI.** Digital object identifier, a persistent identifier registered with DataCite that resolves to a dataset or to one version of it, carries citation metadata, and makes citations countable.

**Embedding.** A list of numbers that a model assigns to a text so that texts with similar meaning have similar numbers; the basis of search by meaning.

**Feature.** A column a model may use as input.

**Fine-tuning.** Changing a model's weights by training it further on the organization's own labelled examples, so that it does one task better or follows the organization's conventions.

**Gate.** The rule that decides whether a change ships, applied to a paired comparison of the evaluation suite before and after the change.

**Harmonization.** The matching of mention variants to canonical identifiers.

**Inventory.** The list of documents with their type, year, page count, text-layer status, and counts of tables and figures.

**Issue.** The review pipeline's output: a detected problem with a category, a severity from 1 to 5, the current value, and a proposed value.

**Label.** The column a model is trained to predict: the occupation code, the transcribed value, the series a question refers to.

**Labelled sample.** Sentences labelled by a person with the dataset mention they contain, or none, used to measure the extractor.

**Language model.** A model that reads and writes text; used in these guides to draft, flag, code, explain, and translate, with a person deciding.

**Map.** The table of model-assisted tasks with phase, role, review, data sensitivity, model location, and owner.

**Match type.** How a mention was matched: exact, phrase (contains), fuzzy, semantic, or none.

**Maturity level.** One of three states used in this guide: foundational, AI-ready, AI-native.

**Mention.** A reference to a dataset in a document, named or unnamed.

**NADA.** The open-source data catalog from the International Household Survey Network, used for the World Bank Microdata Library. It supports DDI Codebook, Dublin Core, ISO 19115/19139, and IPTC.

**Named-entity extraction.** A model that finds spans of text referring to entities of a given type, here dataset mentions, with a confidence.

**OCR.** Optical character recognition: reading text from the image of a page, which is what a scanned document needs before anything can be extracted from it.

**Precision.** The share of extracted mentions that are correct.

**Precision and recall.** Precision is the share of what a system found that is right; recall is the share of what is there that the system found. F1 is the average that combines the two.

**RAG.** Retrieval-augmented generation. A pattern where the system retrieves records first and the model writes the answer from them.

**Recall.** The share of labelled mentions that the extractor found.

**Reference list.** Known uses of the data, assembled from staff knowledge and citation tracking, against which coverage is measured.

**Resource.** Context a server offers to the model or the user, such as code lists or a release calendar, identified by a URI.

**Review board.** The interface in which a curator sees the current and proposed values as a diff and decides.

**SKOS and XKOS.** SKOS is the web standard for publishing controlled vocabularies (concepts with labels and identifiers); XKOS extends it for statistical classifications and their correspondences.

**Split.** The division of a dataset into a training part (the model learns from it), a validation part (the model builder chooses settings on it), and a test part (touched once, to report a score).

**Suite.** A question set, the scripts that score it, the required scores, and the record of runs.

**Text layer.** The machine-readable text inside a PDF; absent in scanned documents until OCR produces it.

**Threshold.** The value of a score (a confidence, a similarity, a garble rate) at which the rule changes what happens to an item; set from measurements.

**Trace.** The logged record of one question: tools called, series used, answer, whether the agent declined, latency.

**Typology of use.** The distinction between mention and use, and among primary, secondary, and background use.

**Use.** A document whose analysis, decision, or statement depends on the data, as opposed to a mention that cites them as context.

**Variant.** A way of naming a dataset other than its canonical name: an acronym, an informal name, a translation, a misspelling.

**World Bank metadata schemas.** JSON Schema definitions published by the Development Data Group for indicators, microdata, documents, geospatial data, tables, images, scripts, and videos, used by its catalogs and the Metadata Editor.

**Zero-shot model.** A model that performs a task from a description of the labels alone, without examples of that task in its training.
