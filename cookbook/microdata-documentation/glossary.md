# Glossary

**Access tier.** A class of release conditions: public use file, licensed file, or secure access, each with its own disclosure control and agreement.

**Adapter.** A small set of trained parameters added to a model for a task, so that fine-tuning fits on modest hardware (parameter-efficient fine-tuning).

**Agent.** An AI system that calls tools to complete a task; here an assistant that calls the organization's data API or MCP server to answer a question about statistics.

**AI-ready.** Data and metadata that software, including AI systems, can find, retrieve, interpret, and cite without manual steps. See the [AI-ready data framework](/docs/ai-ready-framework).

**API.** Application programming interface: the address at which a program asks a system for data and receives it in a structured form.

**BM25.** A keyword ranking function used by most search engines. It matches exact words and weights rare ones more.

**Calibration.** The comparison of model scores with curator scores on a sample, per dimension, to find systematic bias.

**Candidate.** A model shortlisted for a task, with its licence classified and its card checked, to be run on the suite.

**Checksum.** A fingerprint of a file's content (here SHA-256) that changes if one byte of the file changes; used to prove that a file is as released.

**Code list.** A published table of the codes used in a dataset (for geography, periods, categories) with their labels. In SDMX, a code list is part of the data structure definition.

**Concept map.** A table that links each variable to the concept it measures and the classification it follows, with version, level, and URI.

**Coverage.** The share of a reference list of known uses that the collected documents contain.

**Crosswalk.** A mapping from one classification to another, for example from a national occupation classification to ISCO.

**Data appraisal.** The DDI field for known quality issues of a study: coverage gaps, non-response, comparability limits.

**Data dictionary.** The documentation of a data file's variables: names, labels, types, value codes, missing codes, universes, questions.

**Data snapshot.** The image of one table or figure cropped from a page, with its coordinates, class, and source document; the unit of extraction and of citation.

**DataCite.** The registration agency and metadata schema for dataset DOIs. The World Bank Microdata Library assigns DataCite DOIs.

**DCAT.** The Data Catalog Vocabulary, a W3C standard for describing data catalogs and their datasets in machine-readable form so that catalogs can be harvested.

**DDI.** The Data Documentation Initiative, the standard for documenting surveys and their variables, value labels, and files; the World Bank microdata schema is based on it.

**DDI Codebook.** The Data Documentation Initiative standard for documenting a study and its variables; the World Bank microdata schema is its JSON form.

**Decision.** A curator's recorded verdict on a suggestion: accept, edit (with the final text), or reject (with a reason).

**Dense retrieval.** Search that represents queries and records as numeric vectors (embeddings) and ranks by similarity of meaning.

**Derived variable.** A variable computed from others by a stated rule, for example labour force status from the employment questions.

**Disclosure control.** The measurement and reduction of the risk that a released file identifies a person or business or reveals something about one: removal of identifiers, top-coding, coarsening of geography, suppression of rare combinations; applied before any release.

**DOI.** Digital object identifier, a persistent identifier registered with DataCite that resolves to a dataset or to one version of it, carries citation metadata, and makes citations countable.

**Embedding.** A list of numbers that a model assigns to a text so that texts with similar meaning have similar numbers; the basis of search by meaning.

**Fine-tuning.** Changing a model's weights by training it further on the organization's own labelled examples, so that it does one task better or follows the organization's conventions.

**Gate.** The rule that decides whether a change ships, applied to a paired comparison of the evaluation suite before and after the change.

**Harmonization.** The matching of mention variants to canonical identifiers.

**Harmonized name.** A variable name used for the same concept across surveys, tied to one definition.

**ISCED.** The International Standard Classification of Education, whose levels classify educational attainment.

**ISCO-08.** The International Standard Classification of Occupations, whose four-digit codes classify jobs; the label of the coding examples in this guide.

**Issue.** The review pipeline's output: a detected problem with a category, a severity from 1 to 5, the current value, and a proposed value.

**Known-item question.** A test question with one expected identifier, known in advance, used to measure whether a search returns the right record.

**Known-variable question set.** Questions the way users ask for variables, each with the variable that should come first, used to score variable search.

**Label.** The column a model is trained to predict: the occupation code, the transcribed value, the series a question refers to.

**Language model.** A model that reads and writes text; used in these guides to draft, flag, code, explain, and translate, with a person deciding.

**Map.** The table of model-assisted tasks with phase, role, review, data sensitivity, model location, and owner.

**Maturity level.** One of three states used in this guide: foundational, AI-ready, AI-native.

**MCP.** The Model Context Protocol, the open standard through which AI applications discover and call tools, read resources, and use prompts offered by a server, such as a statistics API.

**Mention.** A reference to a dataset in a document, named or unnamed.

**Metadata Editor.** The World Bank's open-source application for documenting data of all the types in the World Bank schemas, with templates and validation, publishing to NADA, and export to SDMX, schema.org, Croissant, and DCAT.

**Missing-value code.** A code in a variable that marks a missing, inapplicable, refused, or unknown response, which has to be labelled so that it is never read as a value.

**MRR.** Mean reciprocal rank: 1 when the right item comes first, one half when it comes second, and so on, averaged over the questions.

**NADA.** The open-source data catalog from the International Household Survey Network, used for the World Bank Microdata Library. It supports DDI Codebook, Dublin Core, ISO 19115/19139, and IPTC.

**OCR.** Optical character recognition: reading text from the image of a page, which is what a scanned document needs before anything can be extracted from it.

**Open-weight model.** A model whose weights can be downloaded and run on the organization's own infrastructure, under a published licence that may be permissive or restricted.

**OpenAPI.** The standard way to describe an API in a file: which addresses exist, what parameters they take, and what they return.

**Precision and recall.** Precision is the share of what a system found that is right; recall is the share of what is there that the system found. F1 is the average that combines the two.

**Provenance.** The record of where a value came from: the series, the release, the source, the document and page, the method, and the version, carried with the value.

**Provenance fields.** The fields every data response carries: series identifier, reference area, unit, release date, source URL, licence, citation, and observation status per value.

**Public use file.** A microdata file released to anyone under terms of use, after disclosure control.

**Quality dimensions.** Completeness, semantic alignment, specificity, and consistency, scored from 1 to 5 with a rubric.

**Question bank.** A repository of question wordings keyed by the concept each measures and the surveys that use each.

**RAG.** Retrieval-augmented generation. A pattern where the system retrieves records first and the model writes the answer from them.

**Read-only.** A tool that reads and returns data and has no path to change anything; the property the server's safety rests on.

**Recall.** The share of labelled mentions that the extractor found.

**Recall@k.** The share of questions for which the right item appears in the first k results.

**Resource.** Context a server offers to the model or the user, such as code lists or a release calendar, identified by a URI.

**schema.org.** A vocabulary that search engines agree on for describing things on web pages; a Dataset record in it, embedded in a page, is how dataset search engines learn what the page is about.

**schema.org Dataset.** A vocabulary for describing datasets on web pages, read by general crawlers and dataset search engines.

**Semantic search.** Search by meaning; see dense retrieval.

**SKOS and XKOS.** SKOS is the web standard for publishing controlled vocabularies (concepts with labels and identifiers); XKOS extends it for statistical classifications and their correspondences.

**Split.** The division of a dataset into a training part (the model learns from it), a validation part (the model builder chooses settings on it), and a test part (touched once, to report a score).

**Statistical disclosure control.** Methods that prevent the identification of individuals from published data.

**Study record.** The study-level documentation of a survey: title, abstract, dates, coverage, universe, design, access conditions.

**Threshold.** The value of a score (a confidence, a similarity, a garble rate) at which the rule changes what happens to an item; set from measurements.

**Trace.** The logged record of one question: tools called, series used, answer, whether the agent declined, latency.

**Universe.** The population a variable applies to, as the question was asked.

**Use.** A document whose analysis, decision, or statement depends on the data, as opposed to a mention that cites them as context.

**Variable group.** A DDI structure that organizes variables by theme for navigation.

**Vocabulary.** A concept scheme with preferred labels, alternates, and URIs, to which free-text keywords and topics are mapped.

**Weight.** A variable that scales each record to the population, with the calibration and the estimates it applies to documented.

**Weight (survey).** The number of population members a record stands for in a survey, kept as a column for population estimates; not a training weight by default.

**World Bank metadata schemas.** JSON Schema definitions published by the Development Data Group for indicators, microdata, documents, geospatial data, tables, images, scripts, and videos, used by its catalogs and the Metadata Editor.

**XKOS.** The DDI Alliance extension of SKOS for statistical classifications and the correspondences between them.
