# Glossary

**Access tier.** A class of release conditions: public use file, licensed file, or secure access, each with its own disclosure control and agreement.

**Agent.** An AI system that calls tools to complete a task; here an assistant that calls the organization's data API or MCP server to answer a question about statistics.

**AI-ready.** Data and metadata that software, including AI systems, can find, retrieve, interpret, and cite without manual steps. See the [AI-ready data framework](/docs/ai-ready-framework).

**API.** Application programming interface: the address at which a program asks a system for data and receives it in a structured form.

**Attribute inference.** The risk that a sensitive attribute of real people can be predicted from their other characteristics through the synthetic file; measured against a baseline.

**Closest-record distance.** The distance from a synthetic record to its nearest real record on the quasi-identifiers; compared with the distance between two halves of the real file.

**Confidence.** A number between 0 and 1 that a model returns with its output to say how sure it is; the basis of a threshold rule.

**Cramér's V.** A measure of association between two categorical variables, from 0 (unrelated) to 1 (fully determined).

**Data dictionary.** The documentation of a data file's variables: names, labels, types, value codes, missing codes, universes, questions.

**DDI.** The Data Documentation Initiative, the standard for documenting surveys and their variables, value labels, and files; the World Bank microdata schema is based on it.

**Decision.** A curator's recorded verdict on a suggestion: accept, edit (with the final text), or reject (with a reason).

**Derived variable.** A variable computed from others by a stated rule, for example labour force status from the employment questions.

**Disclosure control.** The measurement and reduction of the risk that a released file identifies a person or business or reveals something about one: removal of identifiers, top-coding, coarsening of geography, suppression of rare combinations; applied before any release.

**DOI.** Digital object identifier, a persistent identifier registered with DataCite that resolves to a dataset or to one version of it, carries citation metadata, and makes citations countable.

**Edit rule.** A machine-readable condition a record must satisfy (range, consistency), owned by the organization and applied before and after any model proposal.

**Estimated.** The status of an extracted value for which the document offers no check: no printed label, total, or derivation.

**Exact copy.** A synthetic record identical to a real one; a failed check that sends the file back to the method.

**Feature.** A column a model may use as input.

**Fully synthetic.** A file in which every value is generated; the subject of this guide.

**Gate.** The rule that decides whether a change ships, applied to a paired comparison of the evaluation suite before and after the change.

**GPU.** A graphics processing unit, the processor on which language models run fast; its memory decides which model fits.

**GSBPM.** The Generic Statistical Business Process Model, the UNECE reference model of the phases and sub-processes of statistical production, from specifying needs to disseminating and evaluating.

**Issue.** The review pipeline's output: a detected problem with a category, a severity from 1 to 5, the current value, and a proposed value.

**Label.** The column a model is trained to predict: the occupation code, the transcribed value, the series a question refers to.

**Map.** The table of model-assisted tasks with phase, role, review, data sensitivity, model location, and owner.

**Maturity level.** One of three states used in this guide: foundational, AI-ready, AI-native.

**Mention.** A reference to a dataset in a document, named or unnamed.

**Metadata Editor.** The World Bank's open-source application for documenting data of all the types in the World Bank schemas, with templates and validation, publishing to NADA, and export to SDMX, schema.org, Croissant, and DCAT.

**NADA.** The open-source data catalog from the International Household Survey Network, used for the World Bank Microdata Library. It supports DDI Codebook, Dublin Core, ISO 19115/19139, and IPTC.

**Partially synthetic.** A file in which only sensitive variables are replaced; a disclosure control method documented with the public use file.

**Precision.** The share of extracted mentions that are correct.

**Precision and recall.** Precision is the share of what a system found that is right; recall is the share of what is there that the system found. F1 is the average that combines the two.

**Provenance.** The record of where a value came from: the series, the release, the source, the document and page, the method, and the version, carried with the value.

**Public use file.** A microdata file released to anyone under terms of use, after disclosure control.

**Quasi-identifier.** A variable an outsider could know about a person from elsewhere (region, sex, age, education), whose combination can identify someone in a file.

**RAG.** Retrieval-augmented generation. A pattern where the system retrieves records first and the model writes the answer from them.

**Relational synthesis.** Generation of a child table (persons) conditional on a generated parent table (households), preserving the structure.

**Resource.** Context a server offers to the model or the user, such as code lists or a release calendar, identified by a URI.

**Sequential synthesis.** Fitting and generating one variable at a time conditional on the previous ones, with CART or parametric models.

**Synthesis record.** The document that accompanies a synthetic file: source, method and seed, utility and risk results, intended and prohibited uses, label, licence, contact.

**Synthetic data.** Records generated by a model fitted to real data so that they have the same shape and similar relationships while containing no real person's record.

**Target analysis.** A statistic or model that users of the file will compute, compared between the real and the synthetic file in the utility report.

**Threshold.** The value of a score (a confidence, a similarity, a garble rate) at which the rule changes what happens to an item; set from measurements.

**Total variation distance.** A measure of the difference between two categorical distributions, from 0 (identical) to 1 (no overlap).

**Use.** A document whose analysis, decision, or statement depends on the data, as opposed to a mention that cites them as context.

**Utility.** How closely the synthetic file reproduces the real one at the marginal, association, and analysis levels.

**Verified.** The status of an extracted value that matched a printed label, a total, a derivation, or a catalog value.

**Visit sequence.** The order in which variables are synthesized in a sequential method.

**Weight.** A variable that scales each record to the population, with the calibration and the estimates it applies to documented.

**Weight (survey).** The number of population members a record stands for in a survey, kept as a column for population estimates; not a training weight by default.
