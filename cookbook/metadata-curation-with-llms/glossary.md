# Glossary

**Acceptance rate.** The share of model suggestions that curators accept or edit, per field, task, and model.

**Adapter.** A small set of trained parameters added to a model for a task, so that fine-tuning fits on modest hardware (parameter-efficient fine-tuning).

**Agent.** An AI system that calls tools to complete a task; here an assistant that calls the organization's data API or MCP server to answer a question about statistics.

**Agents manifest.** The file that defines the agents of the review pipeline (detectors, critic, categorizer, severity scorer) and their instructions.

**AI-ready.** Data and metadata that software, including AI systems, can find, retrieve, interpret, and cite without manual steps. See the [AI-ready data framework](/docs/ai-ready-framework).

**API.** Application programming interface: the address at which a program asks a system for data and receives it in a structured form.

**Calibration.** The comparison of model scores with curator scores on a sample, per dimension, to find systematic bias.

**Candidate.** A model shortlisted for a task, with its licence classified and its card checked, to be run on the suite.

**Cohen's kappa.** A measure of agreement between two labellers that discounts the agreement expected by chance; 1 is perfect agreement, 0 is chance.

**Confidence.** A number between 0 and 1 that a model returns with its output to say how sure it is; the basis of a threshold rule.

**Coverage.** The share of a reference list of known uses that the collected documents contain.

**Data dictionary.** The documentation of a data file's variables: names, labels, types, value codes, missing codes, universes, questions.

**DDI.** The Data Documentation Initiative, the standard for documenting surveys and their variables, value labels, and files; the World Bank microdata schema is based on it.

**Decision.** A curator's recorded verdict on a suggestion: accept, edit (with the final text), or reject (with a reason).

**Draft status.** The mark on a model-written field that keeps it out of the published catalog until a decision.

**Embedding.** A list of numbers that a model assigns to a text so that texts with similar meaning have similar numbers; the basis of search by meaning.

**Error taxonomy.** The coded kinds of error a component makes, each pointing to a different fix: for an extractor, missed, spurious, boundary, wrong type; for curation suggestions, wrong flag, invented fact, wrong vocabulary term, style.

**Estimated.** The status of an extracted value for which the document offers no check: no printed label, total, or derivation.

**Evaluation set.** Decided records kept to test changes to prompts, manifests, rubrics, and models.

**Flagged.** The status of an extracted value that failed a check and awaits correction with the page open.

**Gate.** The rule that decides whether a change ships, applied to a paired comparison of the evaluation suite before and after the change.

**Grounding.** Restricting a language model to what was retrieved or given for the task: an answer that uses only the retrieved records, a draft that uses only what the record and its named sources support.

**Held-out part.** Questions kept out of development so that a change tuned on the rest is tested on questions it has not seen.

**Issue.** The review pipeline's output: a detected problem with a category, a severity from 1 to 5, the current value, and a proposed value.

**Label.** The column a model is trained to predict: the occupation code, the transcribed value, the series a question refers to.

**Language model.** A model that reads and writes text; used in these guides to draft, flag, code, explain, and translate, with a person deciding.

**LLM.** Large language model. A model that generates text, used here for drafting metadata, answering questions, and grading.

**Manifest.** A file that lists the parts of something so that it can be checked or resumed: for a job, the records and their status; for a release, every file with its checksum; for an agent interface, the design document of its tools, inputs, outputs, examples, and resources.

**Map.** The table of model-assisted tasks with phase, role, review, data sensitivity, model location, and owner.

**Maturity level.** One of three states used in this guide: foundational, AI-ready, AI-native.

**Metadata Editor.** The World Bank's open-source application for documenting data of all the types in the World Bank schemas, with templates and validation, publishing to NADA, and export to SDMX, schema.org, Croissant, and DCAT.

**NADA.** The open-source data catalog from the International Household Survey Network, used for the World Bank Microdata Library. It supports DDI Codebook, Dublin Core, ISO 19115/19139, and IPTC.

**Open-weight model.** A model whose weights can be downloaded and run on the organization's own infrastructure, under a published licence that may be permissive or restricted.

**Prompt.** The instructions and context given to a language model for one task; kept as a versioned file when it is part of a workflow.

**Provenance.** The record of where a value came from: the series, the release, the source, the document and page, the method, and the version, carried with the value.

**RAG.** Retrieval-augmented generation. A pattern where the system retrieves records first and the model writes the answer from them.

**Resource.** Context a server offers to the model or the user, such as code lists or a release calendar, identified by a URI.

**Review board.** The interface in which a curator sees the current and proposed values as a diff and decides.

**Roles.** What a model may do in production: flag, propose, code, explain, draft. It does not decide.

**Rubric.** A written scale that says what each score means, so that two people, or a person and a model, score the same thing the same way.

**schema.org.** A vocabulary that search engines agree on for describing things on web pages; a Dataset record in it, embedded in a page, is how dataset search engines learn what the page is about.

**SKOS and XKOS.** SKOS is the web standard for publishing controlled vocabularies (concepts with labels and identifiers); XKOS extends it for statistical classifications and their correspondences.

**Small model.** A model of roughly one to fifteen billion parameters that runs on one GPU or on CPU, enough for narrow tasks with the right context.

**Split.** The division of a dataset into a training part (the model learns from it), a validation part (the model builder chooses settings on it), and a test part (touched once, to report a score).

**Structured output.** A model's answer returned as data in a declared shape (a JSON object with named fields that conforms to a schema) so that a script can validate, read, and aggregate it.

**Threshold.** The value of a score (a confidence, a similarity, a garble rate) at which the rule changes what happens to an item; set from measurements.

**Trace.** The logged record of one question: tools called, series used, answer, whether the agent declined, latency.

**Use.** A document whose analysis, decision, or statement depends on the data, as opposed to a mention that cites them as context.

**Variable group.** A DDI structure that organizes variables by theme for navigation.

**Vocabulary.** A concept scheme with preferred labels, alternates, and URIs, to which free-text keywords and topics are mapped.

**Weight.** A variable that scales each record to the population, with the calibration and the estimates it applies to documented.

**Weight (survey).** The number of population members a record stands for in a survey, kept as a column for population estimates; not a training weight by default.

**World Bank metadata schemas.** JSON Schema definitions published by the Development Data Group for indicators, microdata, documents, geospatial data, tables, images, scripts, and videos, used by its catalogs and the Metadata Editor.

**XKOS.** The DDI Alliance extension of SKOS for statistical classifications and the correspondences between them.
