# Standards used in this guide

The recipes use published standards wherever one exists. Where the World
Bank's Development Data Group has adopted a standard for its own catalogs and
APIs, the guide uses that one, so that an office following the guide ends up
interoperable with the World Bank and with the other organizations that use
the same standards.

The running example reflects this: the catalog records use the field names of
the World Bank indicator metadata schema, and the values file uses SDMX
cross-domain concept names.

## Catalog records and discovery
