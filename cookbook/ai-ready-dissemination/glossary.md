# Glossary

**Agent.** An AI system that calls tools to complete a task; here an assistant that calls the organization's data API or MCP server to answer a question about statistics.

**AI visibility check.** A fixed set of questions asked of AI assistants on a schedule, recording whether the organization is cited and whether the figures are right.

**AI-ready.** Data and metadata that software, including AI systems, can find, retrieve, interpret, and cite without manual steps. See the [AI-ready data framework](/docs/ai-ready-framework).

**API.** Application programming interface: the address at which a program asks a system for data and receives it in a structured form.

**Benchmark (population).** The share of each group in the population, from the census or population estimates, against which a dataset's composition is compared.

**BM25.** A keyword ranking function used by most search engines. It matches exact words and weights rare ones more.

**Candidate.** A model shortlisted for a task, with its licence classified and its card checked, to be run on the suite.

**Canonical name.** The one name, with its acronym and identifier, under which a dataset's mentions are counted.

**Citation validity.** The share of citations in generated answers that resolve to a real record and support the statement they are attached to.

**Code list.** A published table of the codes used in a dataset (for geography, periods, categories) with their labels. In SDMX, a code list is part of the data structure definition.

**Confidence.** A number between 0 and 1 that a model returns with its output to say how sure it is; the basis of a threshold rule.

**Content-Oriented Guidelines.** The SDMX guidelines that define cross-domain concepts (`REF_AREA`, `TIME_PERIOD`, `OBS_VALUE`, `OBS_STATUS`, `UNIT_MEASURE`, and others) and cross-domain code lists for reuse across statistical domains.

**COUNTER Code of Practice for Research Data.** Rules for logging and reporting dataset views and downloads, including the separation of machine access from regular access.

**Coverage.** The share of a reference list of known uses that the collected documents contain.

**Croissant.** The MLCommons format, built on schema.org, for describing a machine-learning dataset so that tools can load it: its files with their checksums, the fields of each record, and the splits.

**Crosswalk.** A mapping from one classification to another, for example from a national occupation classification to ISCO.

**Data snapshot.** The image of one table or figure cropped from a page, with its coordinates, class, and source document; the unit of extraction and of citation.

**DataCite.** The registration agency and metadata schema for dataset DOIs. The World Bank Microdata Library assigns DataCite DOIs.

**DCAT.** The Data Catalog Vocabulary, a W3C standard for describing data catalogs and their datasets in machine-readable form so that catalogs can be harvested.

**DDI.** The Data Documentation Initiative, the standard for documenting surveys and their variables, value labels, and files; the World Bank microdata schema is based on it.

**DDI Codebook.** The Data Documentation Initiative standard for documenting a study and its variables; the World Bank microdata schema is its JSON form.

**Decision.** A curator's recorded verdict on a suggestion: accept, edit (with the final text), or reject (with a reason).

**Dense retrieval.** Search that represents queries and records as numeric vectors (embeddings) and ranks by similarity of meaning.

**Disclosure control.** The measurement and reduction of the risk that a released file identifies a person or business or reveals something about one: removal of identifiers, top-coding, coarsening of geography, suppression of rare combinations; applied before any release.

**Document record.** The catalog record of a document in the World Bank document schema, with the series and surveys it draws on.

**DOI.** Digital object identifier, a persistent identifier registered with DataCite that resolves to a dataset or to one version of it, carries citation metadata, and makes citations countable.

**Embedding.** A list of numbers that a model assigns to a text so that texts with similar meaning have similar numbers; the basis of search by meaning.

**Estimated.** The status of an extracted value for which the document offers no check: no printed label, total, or derivation.

**Fine-tuning.** Changing a model's weights by training it further on the organization's own labelled examples, so that it does one task better or follows the organization's conventions.

**Flagged.** The status of an extracted value that failed a check and awaits correction with the page open.

**Gate.** The rule that decides whether a change ships, applied to a paired comparison of the evaluation suite before and after the change.

**Grader.** A language model, with a rubric, that scores answers the automatic checks cannot score; validated against human scores before use.

**Grader (judge).** A language model that scores answers with a rubric where no script can; validated against human scores before use.

**Grounding.** Restricting a language model to what was retrieved or given for the task: an answer that uses only the retrieved records, a draft that uses only what the record and its named sources support.

**GSBPM.** The Generic Statistical Business Process Model, the UNECE reference model of the phases and sub-processes of statistical production, from specifying needs to disseminating and evaluating.

**Hallucination.** A statement in a generated answer that has no support in the retrieved material.

**Harmonization.** The matching of mention variants to canonical identifiers.

**ISCED.** The International Standard Classification of Education, whose levels classify educational attainment.

**Issue.** The review pipeline's output: a detected problem with a category, a severity from 1 to 5, the current value, and a proposed value.

**JSON-LD.** JSON with a vocabulary attached, so that each key has a defined meaning that different tools read the same way; the format in which schema.org and Croissant records are embedded in web pages.

**Known-item question.** A test question with one expected identifier, known in advance, used to measure whether a search returns the right record.

**Label.** The column a model is trained to predict: the occupation code, the transcribed value, the series a question refers to.

**Mention.** A reference to a dataset in a document, named or unnamed.

**Metadata Editor.** The World Bank's open-source application for documenting data of all the types in the World Bank schemas, with templates and validation, publishing to NADA, and export to SDMX, schema.org, Croissant, and DCAT.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP).** An open standard through which AI assistants discover and call an organization's tools and read its resources.

**MRR.** Mean reciprocal rank: 1 when the right item comes first, one half when it comes second, and so on, averaged over the questions.

**NADA.** The open-source data catalog from the International Household Survey Network, used for the World Bank Microdata Library. It supports DDI Codebook, Dublin Core, ISO 19115/19139, and IPTC.

**nDCG@k.** Normalized discounted cumulative gain at k. A retrieval measure that credits partially relevant results and rewards placing the best ones first.

**OBS_STATUS.** The SDMX observation status attribute, with codes such as `A` normal, `P` provisional, `B` break in series, `E` estimated.

**Open-weight model.** A model whose weights can be downloaded and run on the organization's own infrastructure, under a published licence that may be permissive or restricted.

**OpenAPI.** The standard way to describe an API in a file: which addresses exist, what parameters they take, and what they return.

**Precision.** The share of extracted mentions that are correct.

**Precision and recall.** Precision is the share of what a system found that is right; recall is the share of what is there that the system found. F1 is the average that combines the two.

**Prompt.** The instructions and context given to a language model for one task; kept as a versioned file when it is part of a workflow.

**Prompt injection.** Text placed in content a system reads (a document, a web page, a query) that is written as an instruction to the model in the hope that the model follows it; tested for before release.

**Provenance.** The record of where a value came from: the series, the release, the source, the document and page, the method, and the version, carried with the value.

**Provenance fields.** The fields every data response carries: series identifier, reference area, unit, release date, source URL, licence, citation, and observation status per value.

**RAG.** Retrieval-augmented generation. A pattern where the system retrieves records first and the model writes the answer from them.

**Read-only.** A tool that reads and returns data and has no path to change anything; the property the server's safety rests on.

**Recall.** The share of labelled mentions that the extractor found.

**Recall@k.** The share of questions for which the right item appears in the first k results.

**Report card.** A run's scores per slice with intervals, the set version, and the component versions, published with a release.

**Resource.** Context a server offers to the model or the user, such as code lists or a release calendar, identified by a URI.

**Review board.** The interface in which a curator sees the current and proposed values as a diff and decides.

**Roles.** What a model may do in production: flag, propose, code, explain, draft. It does not decide.

**Rubric.** A written scale that says what each score means, so that two people, or a person and a model, score the same thing the same way.

**schema.org Dataset.** A vocabulary for describing datasets on web pages, read by general crawlers and dataset search engines.

**SDMX.** Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange, the standard for exchanging aggregate statistical data, their structure, and code lists; its concept names (SERIES, REF_AREA, TIME_PERIOD, OBS_VALUE) are the column names of this series' data files.

**Semantic search.** Search by meaning; see dense retrieval.

**SKOS and XKOS.** SKOS is the web standard for publishing controlled vocabularies (concepts with labels and identifiers); XKOS extends it for statistical classifications and their correspondences.

**Stable identifier.** An identifier for a series or dataset that does not change across releases or site redesigns.

**Statement of model use.** The section of a release's quality report that says where models were used, which, how they performed, who decided, and what the effect was.

**Statistical disclosure control.** Methods that prevent the identification of individuals from published data.

**Structured output.** A model's answer returned as data in a declared shape (a JSON object with named fields that conforms to a schema) so that a script can validate, read, and aggregate it.

**Suite.** A question set, the scripts that score it, the required scores, and the record of runs.

**Switch-off test.** The test that production proceeds with the model layer stopped, with the fallback per task exercised.

**Tidy file.** A data file with one record per row, one variable per column, and the same columns in every row; for extracted data, one row per value with provenance columns (document, page, bounding box, class, title, row, column, value, unit, status).

**Token.** The unit in which language models read and write text, roughly three quarters of a word; prices, context limits, and throughput are counted in tokens.

**Tool use.** The ability of a language model to call functions or APIs during an answer, so that values come from the source.

**Trace.** The logged record of one question: tools called, series used, answer, whether the agent declined, latency.

**Universe.** The population a variable applies to, as the question was asked.

**Use.** A document whose analysis, decision, or statement depends on the data, as opposed to a mention that cites them as context.

**Variable group.** A DDI structure that organizes variables by theme for navigation.

**Variant.** A way of naming a dataset other than its canonical name: an acronym, an informal name, a translation, a misspelling.

**Verified.** The status of an extracted value that matched a printed label, a total, a derivation, or a catalog value.

**Vocabulary.** A concept scheme with preferred labels, alternates, and URIs, to which free-text keywords and topics are mapped.

**Weight.** A variable that scales each record to the population, with the calibration and the estimates it applies to documented.

**Weight (survey).** The number of population members a record stands for in a survey, kept as a column for population estimates; not a training weight by default.

**World Bank metadata schemas.** JSON Schema definitions published by the Development Data Group for indicators, microdata, documents, geospatial data, tables, images, scripts, and videos, used by its catalogs and the Metadata Editor.

**XKOS.** The DDI Alliance extension of SKOS for statistical classifications and the correspondences between them.

**Zero-shot model.** A model that performs a task from a description of the labels alone, without examples of that task in its training.
