# Shared glossary

Every term the cookbooks define, in one place. `scripts/docs/build_glossaries.py`
writes each cookbook's glossary page from this file, keeping the terms whose
name (or a match word in the comment under it) appears in that cookbook's
chapters. Edit terms here; never edit the generated pages.
